YAPC: Yet Another Python Controller
@author ykk
@date October 2010

The YAPC controller is created as an extremely simple controller for
OpenFlow in a high level scripting language like Python.  The
structure of the controller is make as simple as possible to allow
easy extension and deployment.

Background 
========== 

I (KK Yap) have working on NOX for a while now, and there has been a
few other OpenFlow controllers created too.  At the time of writing,
onix and beacon are the other significant complete controllers.
However, none of them are simple to install and use.  Swig is a pain
and OSGI is not small either.  As a bid for simplicity, YAPC is
created.

YAPC incorporates many ideas and lessons I have learnt through working
with NOX.  It is really an manifestion of how I think an OpenFlow
controller should be written at a certain point in time.

Finally, as you mentioned by now, my family name is Yap.  And the
project is named YAPC.  I would like to dedicate the controller to my
son Cayden Yap, who have less attention from Dad as I writes this
controller.

Installation
============

You need Python the dependencies listed below.  That's it.

Dependencies:
* simplejson: for JSON message parsing

YAPC also depends on other external packages to generate some of the
libraries used.  They are listed as follows, though you dun really
have to worry about it most of the time. 

* pylibopenflow: to generate pyopenflow.py library
