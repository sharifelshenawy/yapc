    """COIN's information plane.

    Allows the following to be done
    (1) query for stored information,
    (2) publish and subscribe for information, and
    (3) trigger (and return)

    To separate measurement for its retrieval.

    This component is actually a meta-component that invokes several
    other components, namely: 

    (1) pubsub which handles all publish and subscribe: taking events
    published and sending it to the subscribers (this is not needed if
    all information plane is within the same yapc core, since the
    event model provides this publish-subscribe mechanism already)

    (2) infolog which takes any query and send back the result: this
    component logs all event published and stores it for queries to
    come

    (3) probe which proxy a probe to a measurement component and
    returns the result: the component will match the information type
    with the components as needed.  Note that this should also result
    in a publish event containing the same information. (this is not
    needed if all information plane is within the same yapc core,
    since the event model provides this mechanism for probing already)
